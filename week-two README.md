# finalproject
part two

This week I did not accomplish as much as I wanted for the bootstrap theme, but I did add some basic information on the locations.
I was able to add a nav bar, my goal was to actually have the nav bar working to have the the different sections of the site in their proper section to be able to style each section.
The nav bar is not functional.
